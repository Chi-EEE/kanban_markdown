Uses: [XMake](https://xmake.io/#/guide/installation)

Very simple C++ project which uses:
- fmt - String Formatter
- re2 - Regex
- md4c - Markdown Parser
- tl_expected - expected data structure
- ordered_map - tsl ordered map which keeps the order of insertion

This project was made quickly since I saw that there were no kanban markdown projects which had the features of Trello.  
I might continue this project in the future.
