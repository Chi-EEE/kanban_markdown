# Repo Status

Ready for use. 

The entire contents of multiple Alfa driver DVDs have been uploaded here, containing Windows, Mac, and Linux drivers for Alfa wifi adapters and products. 

DRIVER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AWUS036AC, HOWEVER, ARE A <s>**WORK IN PROGRESS**</s>.  
1. **Update 28 Feb. 2021: I've given up trying to get this 36AC 2.4/5GHz wifi adapter to work properly and reliably on Linux.** See my notes below where I start with ["as of 28 Feb. 2021"](#28feb2021). If you have a good recommendation for an alternative high-speed 5GHz adapter WHICH PREFERABLY ALSO HAS AN EXTERNAL ANTENNA connector, please do tell.
2. **Update 12 May. 2021: I have found the BrosTrend WiFi adapters to be THE BEST FOR LINUX! See my BrosTrend notes and links below.**


# AlfaWiFiAdapterSoftware

This is the software that comes on the CDs with Alfa WiFi adapters. Since most modern computers don't have CD/DVD drives anymore, I find the CDs to be inconvenient, hence why I'm making this repo.

I'll also add a few of my personal installation notes for these Alfa drivers on Linux Ubuntu, as I figure out how to do it.

# All of my Wifi adapter repos:

- **If you are using Linux and desire a high-speed WiFi adapter, I recommend [this BrosTrend Wifi adapter](https://amzn.to/33qXt9i) above all others! It installs with a simple 1-line or 3-line command and has an excellent installation script, as well as great performance, speed, and range.** 
- If you are using Linux and need a Wifi adapter which is _plug-and-play_ and requires NO driver installation, _and_ are okay with it being a bit slower than the BrosTrend one above, then buy a [Panda Wifi adapter like this one](https://amzn.to/2Q0JnZd) instead.

## Disk copy instructions on Linux

References:
1. [my own answer] https://askubuntu.com/questions/17275/how-to-show-the-transfer-progress-and-speed-when-copying-files-with-cp/1275972#1275972
1. https://fideloper.com/user-group-permissions-chmod-apache

Here is how I copied the entire contents of the DVDs above on my Linux Ubuntu computer, FROM directory `/media/gabriel/ALFA Driver DVD` TO directory `~/GS/dev/AlfaWiFiAdapterSoftware`:

```bash
# First, do a dry run to make sure the statistics summary at the end all looks good, and that
# "Number of deleted files" (meaning: files it's going to delete from your destination directory)
# is 0.
time rsync -rah --dry-run --info=progress2 --stats '/media/gabriel/ALFA Driver DVD' ~/GS/dev/AlfaWiFiAdapterSoftware

# When ready, remove the `--dry-run` flag above to actually do the copy. In the event there are any
# disk read errors, simply re-run this command repeatedly until you no longer get any errors and it
# all passes. Any read errors will show up live in the `rsync` terminal output while the command
# runs. If you get read errors, you may need to clean the disk and try again. `rsync` is great in
# that it scans for and only copies changes between source and destination, which makes it as though
# it can pick up where it left off, so re-running the command is usually very fast.
time rsync -rah --info=progress2 --stats '/media/gabriel/ALFA Driver DVD' ~/GS/dev/AlfaWiFiAdapterSoftware

# Once done copying, add (`+`) read/write (`rw`) privileges for your user and group (`ug`) to all
# files you just copied (in the destination directory), like this. This allows you to be able to
# move, modify, rename, etc. them as you see fit using your favorite file manager, such as nemo (my
# favorite; see here for how to install it: https://askubuntu.com/a/1173861/327339) or nautilus (the
# default that comes with Ubuntu).
cd ~/GS/dev/AlfaWiFiAdapterSoftware
chmod -R ug+rw 'ALFA Driver DVD'

```

Here is `--stats` summary I saw after running the command above. It copied 2.98 GB of data in 17 min. 31.65 sec., at an average rate of \~2.83 MB/sec. I used [this external CD/DVD drive which I bought for $27 from Amazon](https://amzn.to/369blHP). It works great! It was plug-and-play on Linux Ubuntu, and required no special setup. I just plugged it into a single USB 3.0 port, from where it drew power as well, and it worked with no problem.

# Driver Installation Instructions on Linux

Here are the drivers I've installed for my use on Linux, and how I installed them. 

1. [Alfa AWUS036NH 2000mW Tx Power 2.4GHz USB Wi-Fi adapter](#AWUS036NH)
1. [Alfa AWUS036AC 802.11ac Long Range AC1200 Dual Band 2.4GHz/5GHz WiFi USB adapter](#AWUS036AC)

<a name="AWUS036NH"></a>
<a id="1-alfa-awus036nh-2000mw-tx-power-24ghz-usb-wi-fi-adapter"></a>
## 1. Alfa AWUS036NH 2000mW Tx Power 2.4GHz USB Wi-Fi adapter

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04. 

<a id="speed"></a>
### SPEED:

This is an old and _slow_ 2.4 GHz-only adapter. [See below](#AWUS036NH_speed).

<a id="install-driver"></a>
### INSTALL DRIVER:

NA. The device is just plug-and-play on Ubuntu now. You don't have to manually install any driver! 

<a name="AWUS036NH-connect-and-configure"></a>
<a id="connect-and-configure"></a>
### CONNECT AND CONFIGURE:

1. With all external wifi adapters UNPLUGGED, see what the name is of your internal wifi card, so we can disable it to force the computer to use the external wifi USB adapter instead.

    ```bash
    iwconfig

    ```

    Mine shows `enp0s31f6`, `wlan0` (connected to my wifi network ESSID), and `lo`. So, `wlan0` is my internal wifi card.

1. Plug in the external USB adapter, and run `iwconfig` again. I now see a `wlan2` adapter as well. That is my external USB adapter.
1. Disable my internal wifi card (`wlan0` in my case) ([source](https://askubuntu.com/a/204536/327339)):

    ```bash
    # Turn OFF your internal wifi card, which you previously determined
    # to be `wlan0`
    # 1) (what I usually use)
    sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
    # 2) OR:
    # sudo ip link set wlan0 down

    # Note: if you ever need to turn it back on, simply run this:
    # 1) (what I usually use)
    # sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
    # 2) OR:
    # sudo ip link set wlan0 up
    ```

1. Now, manually connect your USB adapter to your wifi network: click the drop-down menu at the top-right of your Ubuntu screen --> click the little arrow next to "Wi-Fi Not Connected" --> choose "Select Network", and connect from there. See the image below:

    <p align="left" width="100%">
        <img width="35%" src="images/Selection_035.png"> 
    </p>

1. Once you've connected, run `iwconfig` again:

    ```bash
    iwconfig
    ```

    You should see that `wlan2` (your external USB wifi adapter) is now connected to your network's ESSID (wifi network name) with `Frequency:2.447 GHz`, since this USB adapter works on 2.4GHz only. `wlan0` (your internal wifi card) should NOT be connected to anything now. Also take a look at your key connection information in the `iwconfig` output to see the quality of your connection, such as the following:

    >     Frequency:2.447 GHz
    >     Bit Rate=72.2 Mb/s   Tx-Power=30 dBm
    >     Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-19 dBm  

    A bit rate of 72.2 Mb/sec is normal for this AWUS036NH 2.4GHz adapter, and a link quality of 70/70 with a signal level of -19 dBm is pretty much _perfect._ You can't get much better than that! Higher numbers are better. A really weak signal might look like `Quality=39/70  Signal level=-71 dBm`. To scan for all possible networks to connect to, run:

    ```bash
    iwlist wlan2 scanning
    ```

    And, to search specifically just for your ESSID for your network, filter that output with this command (source: see [my comment under this answer here](https://askubuntu.com/a/261410/327339)):

    ```bash
    iwlist wlan2 scanning | grep -C5 -i 'my_network_name'
    ```

1. You may now go to https://speedtest.net to run a speed test to verify the speed of your connection, or use their [`speedtest` CLI tool](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) from the command-line:

    ```bash
    speedtest
    ```

    <a name="AWUS036NH_speed"></a>
    _Maximum real-life speeds (even at extremely close range) for this Alfa AWUS036NH 2.4GHz USB wifi adapter are_ **\~5\~20 Mbps download (usually closer to 5 Mbps, but also depends highly on the quality and transmit power of your router)** and **\~8\~20 Mbps upload**. It is NOT a high-speed adapter. Instead, it is a **high power** (2000mW Tx power--highest on the market!--even today in the year 2021, despite it being made originally in like 2011 or something!) and **long range** wifi adapter! That's what its specialties are: _high transmit power_ and _long range_, NOT high speed! 

    Again, as far as _speed_ and wifi technology is concerned, this adapter is actually _very old_ and _very slow._ Despite that, and despite its age, however, it is still perhaps _the most powerful consumer wifi adapter available on the market today_, even as of Feb. 2021.

1. Done!


_Notes to self:_

You don't need to do this below anymore, since Ubuntu comes with driver support for this Realtek `RT chipset 3070, rev 0201` now. (See `dmesg` output after plugging in this Wifi adapter to see that it is the 3070 chipset).

## 2. Alfa AWUS036AC 802.11ac Long Range AC1200 Dual Band 2.4GHz/5GHz WiFi USB adapter

<a id="speed-1"></a>
### SPEED:

TBD. See [below](#AWUS036AC_speed).

<a id="install-driver-1"></a>
### INSTALL DRIVER:

Tested on Linux Ubuntu 20.04 with kernel `5.4.0-48-generic` (see the output of `uname -r` to see your kernel version).

With the device NOT plugged in, do:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential git dkms libelf-dev linux-headers-`uname -r`
mkdir ~/Downloads/Install_Files/wifi
cd ~/Downloads/Install_Files/wifi
time git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au.git
cd rtl8812au
time sudo ./dkms-install.sh
```

Now reboot.

Done! Now jump to ["Connect and Configure" below](#AWUS036AC-connect-and-configure).


Sample commands to this wifi adapter:

```bash
# turn device OFF (set interface down)
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down        # what I usually use
# sudo ip link set wlan0 down   # alternative form

# turn device ON (set interface up)
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up          # what I usually use
# sudo ip link set wlan0 up     # alternative form
```

NB: per the link below, do NOT use the below commands on this device. Use the `ip link set` commands above instead.
```bash
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down  # they say do NOT use; use `sudo ip link set wlan0 down` instead
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up    # they say do NOT use; use `sudo ip link set wlan0 up` instead
```

For more info. and commands, see here: https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au. I'm not sure how important or legitimate their recommendation here is, but [they say][rtl8812au]:

>     * Use "ip" and "iw" instead of "ifconfig" and "iwconfig"
>          It's described further down, READ THE README!


_Notes to self:_

1. Driver from Alfa won't build; seems to be an incompatibility issue with Linux kernels more recent than like 5 years ago.

            tar -xvf AWUS036AC_036EAC_ACH_linux_v4.3.2_11100.20140411.tar
            cd AWUS036AC_036EAC_ACH_linux_v4.3.2_11100.20140411
            make
    
    FAILS TO BUILD! See my build errors here: https://github.com/gnab/rtl8812au/issues/207

1. The Alfa AWUS036AC is here: https://www.alfa.com.tw/products_detail/3.htm

<a name="AWUS036AC-connect-and-configure"></a>
<a id="connect-and-configure-1"></a>
### CONNECT AND CONFIGURE:

See and follow the ["Connect and Configure" instructions](#AWUS036NH-connect-and-configure) for the "AWUS036NH" adapter above. 

Note that when I run `iwconfig` with this Alfa AWUS036AC adapter plugged in, I see that it is called `wlx00c0caabd977`. If I unplug it and plug it back in, however, its name may get changed, and sometimes it is called `wlan0` even, while my internal wifi card becomes `wlan1`. You can tell which device is this external AWUS036AC adapter because it says `Nickname:"<WIFI@REALTEK>"` in the first line of `iwconfig` output for this device. 

<a name="AWUS036AC_speed"></a>
When viewing the output from `iwconfig`, a bit rate of \~174 Mbps is normal for this adapter when connected to a **2.4GHz network**. In short-range situations where my laptop's internal 2.4GHz network card gets 30\~50Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds, this adapter, on 2.4Ghz, get's a measly **4\~10 Mbps download** and **3\~10 Mbps upload**. I'm not sure why it sucks so bad. Perhaps it's the driver? 

On a **5GHz network**...todo.

<a name="28feb2021"></a>
**_...as of 28 Feb. 2021 I still can't get this adapter to work properly and reliably on Linux. I'm giving up and looking to buy another adapter that works better with Linux Ubuntu (perhaps the Panda adapters?--but they seem old and low-tech too). If you figure out this Alfa adapter, or have other adapter recommendations for me or are willing to share your experience with me, please open an "Issue" or Pull Request on GitHub here to let me know. Thanks._** (Update 12 May 2021: I use BrosTrend on Linux now--see my links to them above.)
